Brief README for Shadowlands Roadtrip, A vehicle logbook for Android.
This is still beta, not yet version 1.0 software.

Contains:
- roadtrip-an, the Android application
- bookedit, the java viewer for backups from Android
- doc, the documentation

Further documentation will be provided soon, along with screenshots on
the project wiki at https://code.google.com/p/shadowlands-roadtrip/ .

For now, please see the 'doc' directory for details, such as README.developer.

Known limitations:
- No way yet to search by odometer for a previous trip
- Can't yet create a Frequent Roadtrip, or a round-trip Freq Trip
- BookEdit can't upgrade a read-only backup copy from a previous version
- Two copies of the db library source (one each for bookedit and roadtrip-an)
