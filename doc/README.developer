Some common files are duplicated between the android and
bookedit source directories.

In the bookedit source, the android directories are empty or missing.
In the android source, the bookedit and jdbc directories are empty or missing.

The SQL scripts (schemas and database upgrade scripts)
are found in bookedit src/org/shadowlands/roadtrip/db/script/*.sql
