Version history:
	Older revisions were svn, more recent ones are git tags and commits*.
	The project repo was migrated from subversion to git on 2015-05-03;
	for details see roadtrip-svn2git.sh comments.

	See doc/hist/*.sql for previous schema updates.

	* Because a git commit can't predict and include its own hash, a released
	version's copy of versions.txt does not contain its release date or
	its most recent commit hash. The release-#.#.## tag in git points to the
	master commit which was tested for that release, and the released APK's
	About box also shows that same commit hash.

	After release and before continuing development, versions.txt should be
	updated to list the released version's release date and commit hash.

				- Vehicle: Model year no longer required; has always allowed 0 in schema and apps

				- About box: Show build number at bottom, not in title bar. (git hashes are unwieldy up there)
				BookEdit desktop utility app:

				- Better error handling if driver/vehicle settings are missing in db.

62d38f2	0.9.50	2016-05-10	Focus on Flexibility and Usability:
				- For flexibility and simpler UI, all trips start as local; can be converted
				  to roadtrips at any stop. Any stop during roadtrips can be in any geoarea, not only
				  the starting and ending area. The roadtrip's ending area can be changed if needed
				  when ending the trip. If all of a roadtrip's stops are in the starting area, it's
				  converted back to a local trip when ended.
				- Trip stop comment max length increased to 2000 characters from 255
				- More 'business logic' moved from app to DB methods: VehSettings.endCurrentTrip, etc
				SLRoadtrip android app:
				- Can undo some trip actions: Continue Travel From Stop during a trip, End Trip
				- LogbookShow: When searching for trips by location, show matching stops in all caps
				  (in a later version these can be highlighted properly)
				- TripBegin Recent Historical Mode: To more easily enter a series of trips occurring in the past,
				  recognize when the previous trip was 'historical' when entered, and if it was entered recently
				  ask if the current trip should also be historical or should start at the current time.
				- LogbookShow: When picking from 'Other Vehicle' spinner, dismiss that dialog and
				  immediately show new vehicle
				- LogbookShow DatePicker: To always show year spinner, hide calendar pane on narrow screens
				- Odometer calculator dialog:
					- Enable MR, MC buttons only if something is saved to memory
					- To prevent changing odometer to second operand instead of result,
					  disable Save after any op button until Equals, Reset, or Clear is pressed
					- When saving to odometer, ignore negative sign
					- Show operation and memory status to left of input field
				- While validating a backup to restore it, show file size and trip date range
				- VehicleEntry: Fix bug where some fields were read-only when entering new vehicle while previously-
				  current vehicle is on a trip
				BookEdit desktop utility app:
				- Show TStop comments without superfluous square brackets

c34c351	0.9.60	2017-01-30	Improvements and bugfixes since 0.9.50
				SLRoadtrip android app:
				- LogbookShow can add and edit comments in past trips:
					- Tap on trip to see more details
					- From that detail view, tap TStop to add/edit/remove earlier comments
					  or copy comments to clipboard
					- Search by Via Route from menu
					- Also shows "Current Trip in progress" indicator (not shown in 0.9.40 - 0.9.50)
				- Stop during a Trip:
					- For easier use on roadtrips, first non-local stop can be outside all GeoAreas:
					  Added "(none)" to area list shown with local trip's Change button
					- If Location or Via Route created at stop, save any changes to its case/capitalization
				- End Trip:
					- Always show "Save Changes" button to save without ending trip now,
					  even if not currently stopped
					- On roadtrips, use previous stop's GeoArea if possible instead of using
					  trip's end area (which was guessed from first stop outside start area)
				Database schema and model:
				- Location.getByDescr: Use areaID in query
				- TStop: Support for adding/editing comment after continuing from stop,
				  including new flags FLAG_COMMENT_ADDED, FLAG_COMMENT_EDITED, FLAG_COMMENT_REMOVED
				- Trip.TLTR.getTripRowsTabbed: Don't append trailing tabs when final columns are blank
				- VehSettings: During roadtrips, update CURRENT_AREA when new TStop is in a different area

d577e7e	0.9.61	2017-04-02	Improvements and bugfixes since 0.9.60
				SLRoadtrip android app:
				- Logbook validation dialog: If successful and more than 10 days since last backup,
				  ask user if they would like to go to the Backups screen
				- Backups: Always show directory path in activity title
				Database schema and model:
				- LogbookTableModel location search: Also find trips starting from the location,
				  not only those with TStops there
				- Trip: New field so trips' starting location can be searchable
				- TStop: New optional field for total expenses paid at the stop

e4bf4f5	0.9.70	2019-05-20	Improvements and bugfixes since 0.9.61
				SLRoadtrip android app:
				- When starting a trip:

					- Removed redundant "Continue From" row, to de-clutter layout
				- If a backup fails validation and can't be restored, show which level it failed at
				BookEdit desktop utility app:
				- If validation fails, show technical details of failed data items in case they can be triaged or corrected
				Database schema and model:
				- Vehicle:
					- To use a new vehicle immediately, give currency/unit fields their
					  default values in object, not just in DB record
				- RDBVerifier:
					- Give details about failures, keep going up to 100 failures
					- Also validate TStops' ViaRoute from/to locations
